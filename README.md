Perfect 👍 — since this is a **Flutter Study Planner App** assignment, your README should clearly explain what the app does, how to run it, and show screenshots to make your repo professional.

Here’s a well-structured **README.md** you can copy into your project’s root folder (just name it `README.md`).
I’ve also included placeholders where you can later add screenshots and your video link.

# 📚 Study Planner App

A Flutter-based mobile application designed to help students plan, manage, and organize their study tasks efficiently.  
This project was developed as part of an educational assignment to gain hands-on experience with **multi-screen apps**, **navigation**, and **local data storage** in Flutter.

## 🧩 Project Overview

The **Study Planner App** allows users to:
- Create, view, and manage study tasks.
- Set due dates and optional reminder times.
- View tasks in both **Today’s View** and a **Monthly Calendar View**.
- Save all tasks locally using either `SharedPreferences` or `SQLite`.
- Enable or disable reminders from the **Settings Screen**.
